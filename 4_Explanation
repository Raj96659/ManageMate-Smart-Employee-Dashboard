What is an Employee Management System?
>> An Employee Management System is a software application designed to manage employee records and HR-related tasks such as storing personal information, managing attendance, tracking performance, payroll, and more.
   In my project, EMS includes features like login authentication, employee record addition, update, delete, search, and UI using Python’s CustomTkinter, with data stored in MySQL.

Why is an Employee Management System needed?
>> Centralized Data: To maintain all employee records in one place.
>> Efficiency: Automates routine HR tasks, reducing manual work and errors.
>> Quick Access: Speeds up data retrieval (e.g., searching for employee details).
>> Security: Controls access through login systems and proper data validation.
>> Scalability: Makes it easier for organizations to scale and manage large teams.

How does the system work?

Here’s how I built the EMS project:
>> Frontend (UI): Built using CustomTkinter for a modern and interactive interface.
>> Backend (Database): Used MySQL to store employee data securely.
Modules included:
>> Login System: Validates user credentials.
>> CRUD Operations: Add, edit, delete, and view employee records.
>> Search Functionality: Filter/search employee by name, ID, etc.
>> Error Handling & Validations: Using Python and tkinter.messagebox for clean user interaction.
>> Tools Used: Python, CustomTkinter, MySQL, PIL for image handling.
